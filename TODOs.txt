more data types faster
look for some existing python course, see how they teach basics

TODO - if/else should be before loops

types conversion faster
more info on logical conditions, == >= or and
first introduce the for loop, later the while loop
more exercises
also exercises "what will this code output?"
explain difference between print(x) and print("x")


# to check if two values are equal we use "=="
print("do you like pyton? (type yes/no and press [enter])")
answer = input()
if answer == "yes":
    print("no wonder!")
else:
    print("I'll give you one more try")

# a "while" loop can be nested under an "if"
# a "if/elif/else" can also be nested under a "while" loop
print("on a 1-10 scale, how well are you today? (type and press [enter])")
happiness = int(input())
if happiness > 5:
    i = 0
    while i < happiness:
        print("happy!")
        i = i + 1

# exercie 1: modify the asterisks-triangle program so that it will
# not print triangles higher than 20. When the user input a number
# greater than 20 we should inform him that the number is too large

# exercise 2: modify the asterisks-triangle program so that it will
# also print triangles of height 20-30 but preceed them with a
# message: "you're quite demanding, but I'll manage!"

# exercise 3: extend the asterisks-triangle program so that it will
# also print triangles of height 30-40 but preceed them with a
# message: "watch out! you're near the limit!"
