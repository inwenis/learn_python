TODO - if/else should be before loops
more data types faster
types conversion faster
more info on logical conditions, == >= or and
first introduce the for loop, later the while loop
more exercises
also exercises "what will this code output?"
explain difference between print(x) and print("x")


# to check if two values are equal we use "=="
print("do you like pyton? (type yes/no and press [enter])")
answer = input()
if answer == "yes":
    print("no wonder!")
else:
    print("I'll give you one more try")
