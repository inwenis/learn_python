Could do scripts about:
    - more on lists - functions
    - text is a list
    - string split
    - data structures
    - datetime
    - dictionaries
    - classes
    - character details
    - tuple/sets
    - lambda
    - array
    - classes
    - try except
    - files
    - module/packages/pip
    - regex
    - working with excel
    - break/continue

More exercises:
    - what will this code output?
    - exercise with fixing errors

Ideas:
    - more details about lists/types without so many explanations
        - maybe a version with more build in functions for more advanced ppl
          more material, less explenations
    - add a README and "where to go next"?
    - remove markdown exercises (some people will try to run them as a .py file)
