# as you noticed everything after a hash sign # is plain english and is ignored by python
# the hash sign # begins a comment - text ignored by the python interpreter
# programmer use comments to describe what the code is intended to do, or why it was written
# below some examples of comments you might find in actual code:

# compute and display total debt for a customer

# compute stardard deviation for time series and add it to message (I have no idea why, but traders demanded it)

# shipping department has a bug in their system, this wierd code is a workaround, remove once shipping systme is fixed!
