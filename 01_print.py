# As you noticed everything after a hash sign # is plain english and
# is ignored by python. The hash sign # begins a comment - text
# ignored by the python interpreter.
# During our classes comments are used for explanations and
# exercises. Usually programmers use comments to describe what the
# code is intended to do, or why it was written. Comments usually
# are placed above code.
# Sample comments from real large scale systems:

# Should be removed when all business tools uses DeleteTrade (from ETRM/Allegro)

# For multi hour trades, DST long day and DST short day are currently not handled correctly (from ETRM/Allegro)

# compute stardard deviation for time series and add it to message
# (I have no idea why, but finance department requested it)

# shipping department has a bug in their system, this weird code is
# a workaround, remove once shipping system is fixed!
