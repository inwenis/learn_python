# As you noticed everything after a hash sign # is plain english and
# is ignored by python. The hash sign # begins a comment - text
# ignored by the python interpreter. Programmers use comments to
# describe what the code is intended to do, or why it was written.
# Below some examples of comments you might find in enterprise code:

# compute and display total debt for a customer

# compute stardard deviation for time series and add it to message
# (I have no idea why, but finance department demanded it)

# shipping department has a bug in their system, this wierd code is
# a workaround, remove once shipping system is fixed!
