# Simple introduction to python

## Why did I write those scripts?
To help me teach programming and python.

## Do I need to explain something to my students?
If you're using those scripts you'll need to explain your students how to run them (e.g. in PyCharm).

## What are they good for?
If you're teaching a group of people, some understanding what a variable or function is and others have never wirtten a line of code - these scripts are a good way for the first class to make sure the newcommers have a general understanding of programming.

## How much time?
People with prior experience finish them in 2-3 h.

People with no prior experience usually finish on script 7 after 2-3 hours.

## Where to find solution?
On the `solutions` branch [here](https://github.com/inwenis/learn_python/tree/solutions)

## Sample class plan
Python classes I've conducted are 4 x 4h, once a week.

Session 1:
1. Explain how to install python and PyCharm.
1. Demonstrate how to find those scripts on github.
1. Demonstrate how to copy-paste them into PyCharm and run.
1. Ask students to work on scripts and ask you for any help.
1. A break after every ~40 min of coding.
1. After breaks go though solution for scripts finished by everybody.
1. Leave last hour for questions, let student go home after 3 x 40 minutes of coding.

## Where to go next?
After those scripts I usually teach python more lecutre like with slides, introducing more syntax/build-in functions.
Exercises done on subsequent classes are bigger (code katas found on the internet).
