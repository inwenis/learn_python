# When you write code like below you create a variable.
x = 123
# We have created a variable, called "x" and assigned it the value
# 123. python will on our behalf reserve some memory and store the
# value 123 in it.

# Whenever we would like to access this value we need to use the
# variable name "x".
print(x)

# We can create as many variables as we want.
y = 42
z = 50
the_greatest = 999
# Variable names can not contain spaces.
# Name of a variable should hint what it will be used for.
pi = 3.14
current_year = "2019" 
welcome_message = "Welcome to our homepage"

# this is a bad name
three = 3
# this is much better
max_cards_per_user = 3

# variables can be used in many ways
c = y + z
print(c)

print(welcome_message + " in " + current_year)

# exercise 1: create two variables, assign some big numbers to them
# and print their sum, difference, product (multiplication),
# quotient (division)
