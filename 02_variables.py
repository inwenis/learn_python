# when you write code like below you create a variable
x = 123
# we have created a variable, called "x" and assigned the value 123 to it
# python will on our behalf reserve some memory and store the value 123 in it

# whenever we would like to access this value we need to use the variable name "x"
print(x)

# we can create as many variables as we want
y = 42
z = 50
the_greatest = 999
# variable names can not contain spaces
# name of a variable should hint what it will be used for
pi = 3.14
current_year = "2019" 
welcome_message = "Welcome to our homepage"

# this is a bad name
three = 3
# this is much better
max_cards_per_user = 3

# variables can be used in many ways
yz_sum = y + z
print(yz_sum)

print(welcome_message + " in " + current_year)

# exercise 1: create two variables, assign some big numbers to them and
# print their sum, difference, product (multiplication), quotient (division)
