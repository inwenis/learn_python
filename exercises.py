# exercise 1: 
Write a program which given the number N will compute the sum of all
numbers dividable by 3 and 5 which are less or equal to N.
N=10 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 = 33

# exercise 2: Factorial
Write a program which will compute factorial N.
N factorial denoted as n! is the product of all numbers less than or equal.
3! = 3x2x1 = 6
7! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040

# exercise 3: Reversed

- do it using slicing
- without slicing

# exercise 4: square

Modify the program so that the length will be inputed from console.

# exercise 5: Fibonacci
Write a program which will print out N elements of the fibonacci sequence.
For each printed fibonacci number also print out the ratio of the current
Fibonacci number to the previous.
What happens when you request a lot of Fibonacci numbers?
